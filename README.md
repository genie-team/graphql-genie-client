A React app providing a demo and example of [GraphQL Genie](https://github.com/genie-team/graphql-genie). __No coding required__.
All you need is to write [GraphQL Type Schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) (or use the example provided). See how [GraphQL Genie](https://github.com/genie-team/graphql-genie) turns graphql type definitions into a fully featured GraphQL API with referential integrity and inverse updates. 

Data can be mocked, stored in memory or stored in your browsers IndexedDB (so refreshing doesn't wipe out your data).

## Roadmap
Ability to export data
## Development

```sh
yarn
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Thanks/Credit
